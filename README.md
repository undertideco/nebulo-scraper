# nebulo-scraper

This is the web scraper our app [Nebulo](https://nebulo.undertide.co) uses to scrape air quality data for Singapore,
Malaysia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

It's built to run off Heroku with a scheduled task `node
bin/hurricane.js`

It's perhaps the most lo-fi setup ever.

## Usage
Literally. Don't. Feel free to use the scripts in [`app/scrapers`](https://github.com/undertideco/nebulo-scraper/tree/master/app/scrapers) and forget the rest.

## Questions?
Feel free to create an issue or @ me [@jurvistan](https://twitter.com/jurvistan/)
