# nebulo-scraper

This is the web scraper our app [Nebulo](https://getnebulo.com) uses to scrape air quality data for Singapore,
Malaysia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

It's built to run off Heroku with a scheduled task `node
bin/hurricane.js`

It's perhaps the most lo-fi setup ever.

## Usage
Literally. Don't. Feel free to use the scripts in `app/scrapers` and
forget the rest.
